## Introduction

A 5 day weather forecasting app.
The first project in [ManchesterCodes](www.manchestercodes.com) Frontend unit.
Available to [view in browser](http://pbc-weather-app.herokuapp.com/), hosted on heroku.


## Overview
The App displays the weather for today and the next 5 days. 
It initially shows the weather for Manchester, but the user can search for other locations.
Details of the weather for today are also displayed, and the user can select details for any other day displayed.

With more time I would:

  Do a drop down of cities/towns available when searching.
